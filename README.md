## About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently diving deep into the world of PHP/Symfony application design at [OpenClassrooms](https://www.openclassrooms.com/).
My journey in web development has been fueled by a passion for discovering new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.

I have hands-on experience with Docker, which I've used to set up both home labs and web servers.
This practical knowledge has been instrumental in honing my abilities to create robust and efficient development environments.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have any questions!
